# Newspaper Report Classification Model

This project demonstrates a text classification model that categorizes newspaper reports based on their headline and summary. The model is built using Python, leveraging the **TF-IDF vectorization** technique and **Logistic Regression** for classification.


## Overview

This project aims to classify newspaper articles into predefined categories. It includes:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text.
- TF-IDF vectorization: Converting text into numerical format.
- Model training: Logistic Regression for classification.
- Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.



## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `nltk`



## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
